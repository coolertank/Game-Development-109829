A target shooting game is an excellent first project for a Unity newbie. When you first use Unity, you’ll select a new project from the pop-up dialog box. You will need to choose an appropriate file directory for your basic first-person shooter (FPS) game. 
2)3D Magnetic Block Breaker
Breakout, which Atari first released in 1972, is one of the first video games ever created and is considered a classic. Since its initial debut, users have replicated its source code on many different platforms. In recreating this project, you will employ the 2D catch game from the Unity engine and the Infineon 3D Magnetic Sensor to create your own creative version of this iconic video game.
3)Pong Clone
Pong is a well-known classic in the video game industry. Recreating it can be a great beginner-level project idea that will put your Unity skills to the test. Since many players are already familiar with Pong, it’s easy to develop this 2D game and troubleshoot any difficulties.
